Automatic login for League of Legends. See the [official website page](https://www.nicoco007.com/other-stuff/lol-auto-login/) for more information.

# Known issues
* The client window is sometimes not detected correctly and the program fails to log in.
* ~~Sometimes, the client refuses to recieve keyboard input from LoL Auto Login. Restarting once or twice usually fixes the issue.~~ Seems to be working nearly 100% of the time now.
* ~~Logging into the Alpha Client sometimes causes an "Authentication Failed" error **or** fails to trigger the login button; Might be related to speed.~~ Seems to work now, probably was an issue with the client itself.
