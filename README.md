# LoL Auto Login
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ie2065acev0ag2v7?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nicoco007/lol-auto-login)

Automatic login for League of Legends. See the [official website page](https://www.nicoco007.com/other-stuff/lol-auto-login/) for more information.

# Known issues
* ~~Logging into the Alpha Client sometimes causes an "Authentication Failed" error **or** fails to trigger the login button; Might be related to speed.~~ Seems to work now, probably was an issue with the client itself.
* ~~Sometimes, the client refuses to recieve keyboard input from LoL Auto Login. Restarting once or twice usually fixes the issue.~~ Seems to be working nearly 100% of the time now.
